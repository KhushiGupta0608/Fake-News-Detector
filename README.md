# Fake-News-Detector
Machine learning model deployed in a website to detect fake news.

This is a python project to detect news and predict it as fake or real. It is based on supervised Machine Learning algorithms with dataset provided at the beginning. I built a TfidfVectorizer on our dataset using sklearn. Then, initialized a PassiveAggressive Classifier and fitted the model. Calculated the accuracy score to know how well the model fares.
Then this model is deployed in an html interface i.e. website using flask.
